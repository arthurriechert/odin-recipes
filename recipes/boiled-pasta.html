    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Boiled pasta is a classic and versatile culinary staple that embodies comfort and 
        simplicity. The process of boiling pasta begins with selecting your preferred 
        pasta shape, such as spaghetti, penne, or fusilli, and bringing a pot of salted 
        water to a rolling boil. <em>Once the water is boiling, the pasta is added and cooked 
        until al dente, meaning it retains a slight firmness to the bite.</em> The boiled pasta 
        transforms into a tender and satisfying dish that serves as a canvas for a wide 
        range of flavors and sauces.
    </p>
    <p>
        When properly cooked, boiled pasta becomes the perfect vessel for a multitude of 
        flavors and ingredients. Its neutral taste allows it to absorb the flavors of 
        accompanying sauces, whether it be a rich tomato sauce, a creamy Alfredo, or a 
        vibrant pesto. <em>The texture of boiled pasta varies depending on the shape and cooking 
        time, from delicate strands of spaghetti to toothsome tubes of rigatoni.</em> This 
        adaptability makes boiled pasta suitable for a myriad of culinary creations, 
        from simple weeknight dinners to elaborate gourmet dishes. Whether enjoyed as a 
        standalone dish or combined with other ingredients, boiled pasta brings comfort 
        and versatility to the dining table, making it a beloved and timeless choice for 
        pasta lovers worldwide.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta of your choice (such as spaghetti, penne, fusilli, etc.)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt (for seasoning the water and pasta)</li>
        <li>Optional: Olive oil (to prevent sticking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Boil water:</strong> Fill a large pot with water, allowing enough space to accommodate 
            the pasta. Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add salt:</strong> Once the water is boiling, add a generous amount of salt to the pot. 
            The salt enhances the flavor of the pasta as it cooks. A general guideline is 
            to use about 1-2 tablespoons of salt per 4-6 quarts (4-6 liters) of water.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add pasta:</strong> Carefully add the desired amount of pasta to the boiling water. 
            Stir gently to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Adjust the heat, if 
            necessary, to maintain a steady boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook until al dente:</strong> Follow the package instructions for the recommended cooking 
            time of the specific pasta you are using. As the pasta cooks, check for doneness 
            by periodically tasting a small piece. The pasta should be cooked until it is al 
            dente, which means it is cooked through but still has a slight firmness when 
            bitten.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Drain the pasta:</strong> Once the pasta is cooked to your desired doneness, carefully pour 
            the contents of the pot into a colander or strainer to drain the water. Shake the 
            colander gently to remove excess water.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optional:</strong> Rinse the pasta (if desired): In some cases, you may choose to rinse the 
            pasta with cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent it from becoming too 
            soft. However, rinsing is not necessary for all pasta dishes, especially when using 
            a sauce that will adhere better to the pasta without rinsing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Transfer the drained pasta to a serving dish or individual plates. 
            Toss it with your desired sauce, whether it's a homemade sauce or a store-bought 
            variety. Mix well to coat the pasta evenly. Garnish with additional ingredients 
            like grated cheese, herbs, or a drizzle of olive oil, if desired. Serve the boiled 
            pasta while it is hot and enjoy its comforting and versatile nature.
