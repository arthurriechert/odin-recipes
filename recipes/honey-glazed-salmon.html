        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Honey-glazed salmon is a delectable culinary delight that combines 
            the rich flavors of fresh salmon with the subtle sweetness of honey. 
            This dish starts with a perfectly cooked salmon fillet, typically 
            brushed with a glaze made from a harmonious blend of honey, 
            soy sauce, and Dijon mustard. <em>The honey acts as a natural sweetener, 
            adding a luscious caramelized coating to the salmon while enhancing 
            its inherent buttery texture.</em> As the glaze cooks, it forms a glossy, 
            sticky coating that not only imparts a delightful sheen to the salmon 
            but also locks in its moisture, resulting in a succulent and tender fish. 
            The honey's delicate sweetness beautifully balances the savory umami notes 
            from the soy sauce and the tangy kick from the Dijon mustard, creating a flavor 
            profile that is both satisfyingly complex and harmoniously balanced. 
            The finished honey-glazed salmon boasts a mouthwatering combination of flavors,
            with each bite offering a delightful blend of sweet, savory, and slightly 
            tangy notes.

            Serving honey-glazed salmon is often accompanied by a variety of complementary 
            ingredients that further enhance its taste and presentation. <em>It pairs exceptionally 
            well with vibrant and crisp vegetables like roasted asparagus or steamed broccoli, 
            which provide a refreshing contrast to the rich salmon.</em> The salmon's sweetness and 
            savory glaze can also be beautifully balanced by serving it alongside a fluffy bed 
            of fragrant jasmine rice or a medley of quinoa and wild rice. Additionally, a 
            garnish of fresh herbs, such as chopped dill or parsley, adds a pop of color and a 
            touch of freshness to the dish. Whether served as the star of an elegant dinner party 
            or enjoyed as a wholesome weeknight meal, honey-glazed salmon is a culinary masterpiece 
            that never fails to impress with its harmonious blend of flavors and stunning visual appeal.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 salmon fillets (about 6 ounces/170 grams each)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: Olive oil (for brushing the salmon)</li>
            <li>Optional: Fresh herbs (such as dill or parsley) for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C) 
                to ensure it's hot and ready when you're ready to bake the salmon.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the glaze:</strong> In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup of honey, 
                2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard. 
                Stir well until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed and form a smooth glaze.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the salmon:</strong> Place the salmon fillets on a baking sheet 
                lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Season the fillets 
                with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, you can also brush a 
                light layer of olive oil on the salmon to help prevent sticking and 
                promote a crispier texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Apply the glaze:</strong> Brush the honey glaze generously over the salmon 
                fillets, ensuring they are evenly coated. Make sure to reserve 
                a small amount of glaze for later use.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake the salmon:</strong> Place the baking sheet with the salmon in the 
                preheated oven and bake for approximately 12-15 minutes, or 
                until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. 
                The glaze will caramelize and create a beautiful golden-brown coating.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Apply a final glaze:</strong> About halfway through the cooking time, 
                brush another layer of the reserved glaze onto the salmon fillets. 
                This will intensify the flavor and add an extra glossy finish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Once the salmon is cooked, remove it from the oven 
                and let it rest for a few minutes. This will allow the flavors to 
                meld together and the glaze to set. Serve the honey-glazed salmon with 
                your choice of sides, such as roasted vegetables or rice. Garnish with 
                fresh herbs, if desired, and savor the delicious combination of flavors.
