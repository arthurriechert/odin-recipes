        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Steamed broccoli is a versatile and nutritious vegetable that stands out 
            with its vibrant color and delightful texture. This simple yet satisfying 
            dish begins by carefully trimming fresh broccoli into bite-sized florets. 
            These florets are then steamed until tender, resulting in a bright green 
            vegetable that retains a slight crunch. <em>The steaming process not only 
            brings out the broccoli's natural flavors but also preserves its essential 
            nutrients, including vitamins C and K, fiber, and antioxidants.</em> The steamed 
            broccoli maintains its structural integrity, allowing it to be easily enjoyed 
            on its own or incorporated into various recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The taste of steamed broccoli is pleasantly mild, with a subtle earthy essence 
            that is complemented by a hint of sweetness. Its gentle flavor pairs well with 
            a wide range of seasonings, from a simple sprinkle of salt and pepper to a 
            drizzle of lemon juice or a dash of garlic. <em>The tender-crisp texture of steamed
            broccoli adds a delightful contrast to dishes, whether it's tossed into salads, 
            stirred into stir-fries, or served as a nutritious side alongside grilled meats 
            or roasted chicken.</em> With its vibrant color, nourishing qualities, and culinary 
            versatility, steamed broccoli is a go-to choice for those seeking a healthful 
            and visually appealing addition to their meals.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the broccoli:</strong> Start by rinsing the fresh broccoli 
                florets under cold water. Trim off any tough stems and cut the broccoli 
                into bite-sized florets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Set up the steamer:</strong> Fill a large pot with about an inch 
                of water. Place a steamer basket or insert into the pot. Make sure the 
                water level is below the steamer basket.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Steam the broccoli:</strong> Bring the water in the pot to a boil 
                over medium-high heat. Once the water is boiling, carefully place the 
                broccoli florets into the steamer basket. Cover the pot with a lid.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Steam for desired tenderness:</strong> Steam the broccoli for about 
                5-7 minutes, or until the florets are tender but still have a slight crispness. 
                You can check the doneness by poking a floret with a fork or tasting a piece.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Season and serve:</strong> Once the broccoli is steamed to your desired 
                tenderness, remove it from the steamer basket and transfer it to a serving dish. 
                Season with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings such as lemon juice or 
                garlic. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil if desired. Toss gently to evenly coat the 
                broccoli.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve the steamed broccoli immediately as a side dish or 
                incorporate it into your favorite recipes. It pairs well with various dishes, from 
                roasted meats to stir-fries and pasta. Savor the vibrant and nutritious flavors of 
                the steamed broccoli.
